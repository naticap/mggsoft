**REST Client script**
Sorry I didn't provide _Postman Collection_ script but I replace with REST Client script 
inside `mggsoft.rest` file. If you install REST Client on your VSCode then it will easy to run.
but if not. you need to manually copy json and its endpoint. but it only few endpoint. Please do some check .. thanks
